# RainfallPrediction
A small python project I submitted for my IBM Machine Learning with Python course in Coursera. This project was required for their honors certificate. 
I used the weather Data from Sydney Australia during January 2023. The program uses different classification and regression methods 
to predict the rainfall of the region. I implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, etc in this. I was able to apply my knowledge succesfully for this project
